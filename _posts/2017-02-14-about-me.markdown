Hello!

 My name is Sofia Ozelkan and I am a 26 yr old Product Manager based in Broomfield, Colorado. I graduated from Loyola University Maryland with a BS in Biology. My start in tech is a bit unorthodox. After graduating college, I attended DevBootcamp, an immersive 19-week program to learn coding. I studied Ruby, React and Javascript. I found satisfaction when running my local server and I was able to see my project come to fruition on a web page. Since 2017, I have worked at enterprise-scale SaaS companies including Chartbeat and SiteCompli.

 When I am not geeking out over technology, I can be found at the dog run with my Rat terrier, Mavi or snuggling at home with my resident cat, Stella or one of my foster cats. While everyone naps, I love to spend time solving jigsaw puzzles or the latest brain teaser puzzles.
