I co co-created a web app that acts as an IMDB clone. It allows users to search by genre for movies or by movie title.
Each movie page contains information about the movie as well as a trailer. Users can review and favorite movies, which show on their profile. The app utilizes the OMDB API to search for movies and the YouTube API to search for a movie trailer.
