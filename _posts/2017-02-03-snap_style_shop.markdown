I co-created a web app that shortens the distance between consumers, their preferences, and the fashion world.
Snap+Style+Shop is a search engine that allows users to find clothing items similar in color and style, to the image that insert to the app. The app utilizes the Google Cloud Vision API to render a type of clothing article and a color. The app also utilizes the ShopStyle API to use those results and render products of the same style. This web app allows users to find clothing similar to their style.
