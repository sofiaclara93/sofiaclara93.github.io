<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Sofia Ozelkan and I am a 23 yr old web developer from New York. I have a big love for animals, so much so that I have a BS in Biology from Loyola University Maryland! My start in programming is very unorthodox. After pursuing a career in the veterinary field, I found that I become emotionally attached.  When I began to pursue programming, my pursuits were self-taught. I ran into many obstacles, but found them intriguing and challenging, enough to inspire me to work through them. I found excitement in spending time debugging my code, researching error messages, and creating small changes to view the outcomes associated with my minute adjustments. I found satisfaction when running my local server and I was able to see my project come to fruition on a web page.</p>
