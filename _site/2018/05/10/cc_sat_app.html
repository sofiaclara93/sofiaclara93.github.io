<p>I created a Single Page App using React and an express server to display our Solution team’s satisfaction rate including the total of good and bad responses we received. To make the app more interactive, I created a carousel of changing comments that are pulled from Zendesk’s APIs. By displaying the team’s total number of tickets received and solved, the app provides historical benchmarks for the team to determine how well they are performing.</p>

<p>Building this app was a great way to learn React and how components function together. By using the Express server I learned how to incorporate a React app with a backend server, and how these two processes function together.</p>
